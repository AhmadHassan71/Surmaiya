# Surmaiya - Enchantress of Melody
Existing music streaming platforms often overwhelm users with vast libraries and broad categories, leaving them feeling lost and unable to truly connect with their musical preferences. Genre exploration is often limited, and personalized recommendations lack the depth and precision desired by true music aficionados.
